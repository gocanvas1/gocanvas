What is GoCanvas?
The mobile-base GoCanvas solution helps companies eliminate their paperwork processes and allows them to share documents such as inspections, work orders, invoices, time cards and daily field reports in real-time across the business. Once the forms are submitted, from a back end cloud database, you can visualize all of the information that has been collected, in a way that works for your business so you can make faster, more informed decisions.

Who uses GoCanvas?
Businesses of all shapes and sizes in over 65 countries, from independent contractors to Fortune 100s, especially in construction, field service, HVAC, manufacturing, engineering, energy, and retail.
